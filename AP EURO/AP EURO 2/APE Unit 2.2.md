#         THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION PT. 2  

##### So the printing press actually helped a lot with the spreading of the reformation with the fact that his ideas could spread throughout German states. Even one of Luther's main arguments was that the bible should be translated into German, basically saying the need for vernacular bibles. 

##### By 1523 there was a French translation of the new testament, an English version by 1526 also.

##### This also helped with challenging the papacy in general. Like in England where the church of England was made cause henry was like "man fuck the pope". But it really wasn't to different from the Catholic Church so Elizabeth I got a bunch of "Puritans" to basically finish the job and remove Catholicism Then also blah blah blah Civil war and Puritans came out on top.

  ##### And Anabaptists believed in a break from the church and state and were also anti war.
