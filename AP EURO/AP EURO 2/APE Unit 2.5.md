## **Family and Gender Roles**

- **Protestant Views:**
    
    - Rejected celibacy → marriage became the expected life path for clergy and laity alike.
        
    - **Clergy marriage** (e.g., Luther married ex-nun Katharina von Bora).
        
    - Women valued as **wives and mothers**, responsible for teaching children Christian morals.
        
    - Reduced opportunities for women in religious life → convents closed in many Protestant regions.
        
- **Catholic Views:**
    
    - Continued to value virginity, celibacy, and monastic life as spiritual ideals.
        
    - Convents remained spaces where women could gain education and influence (e.g., Teresa of Ávila).
        
- **Impact on Women:**
    
    - Protestantism elevated motherhood and domestic responsibility but limited public religious roles.
        
    - Catholicism preserved female spiritual autonomy in convents but often restricted broader participation in church leadership.

## **II. Education and Literacy**

- **Protestant Stress on Bible Reading:**
    
    - Luther’s emphasis on _sola scriptura_ → literacy became essential.
        
    - Expansion of schools so ordinary people could read scripture.
        
    - Girls were increasingly educated in Protestant regions, though mostly for family/religious roles.
        
- **Catholic Education:**
    
    - Jesuit schools/universities trained clergy and lay elites.
        
    - Ursulines founded schools for girls, emphasizing Catholic piety.
        
- **Result:**
    
    - Broad expansion of literacy and schooling in both Protestant and Catholic Europe.
        
    - Education tied closely to religious identity and confessional discipline.

## **III. Popular Culture and Religious Practice**

- **Protestant Changes:**
    
    - Rejection of saints, relics, pilgrimages, indulgences, and festivals.
        
    - Churches became plainer (iconoclasm in Calvinist regions).
        
    - Music in worship simplified (though Lutherans kept hymns, Calvinists restricted music).
        
- **Catholic Continuity and Baroque Renewal:**
    
    - Feast days, rituals, and pilgrimages retained and often expanded.
        
    - Baroque art, architecture, and music (Bach, Bernini, Caravaggio) reinforced Catholic culture.
        
- **Cultural Division:**
    
    - Protestants moved toward **sober, disciplined culture**.
        
    - Catholics embraced **ritual, spectacle, and sensory devotion**.

## **IV. Witchcraft Craze (16th–17th Centuries)**

- **Causes:**
    
    - Religious tensions (both Catholics and Protestants hunted witches).
        
    - Social/economic stress (wars, famine, plague) led to scapegoating.
        
    - Fear of women outside male authority (widows, healers, midwives).
        
- **Scale:**
    
    - Tens of thousands executed, mostly women.
        
    - Strongest in areas of intense religious conflict (HRE, Switzerland, France).
        
- **Decline:**
    
    - Scientific revolution and state centralization weakened belief in magic by late 17th century.

## **V. Religious Pluralism and Toleration**

- **Tolerance in Some States:**
    
    - Netherlands and Poland became relatively tolerant (Calvinists, Lutherans, Catholics, Jews, and others coexisted).
        
    - French Edict of Nantes (1598) → limited Huguenot toleration (later revoked).
        
- **Intellectual Push for Toleration:**
    
    - Thinkers like Sebastian Castellio, Jean Bodin, and Michel de Montaigne argued against religious violence.
        
- **Reality:**
    
    - Most of Europe still pursued confessional uniformity.
        
    - Persecution and exclusion remained common.

## **VI. Everyday Life and Social Norms**

- **Stricter Moral Codes:**
    
    - Calvinist Geneva: banned gambling, dancing, drunkenness, extravagant dress.
        
    - Both Protestants and Catholics imposed new standards of discipline in daily life.
        
- **Charity and Social Welfare:**
    
    - Protestant communities emphasized responsibility for the poor, often tied to parish oversight.
        
    - Catholic orders (Jesuits, Capuchins, Ursulines) expanded charity, hospitals, and education.
        
- **Shift in Authority:**
    
    - Church courts declined in Protestant areas; secular/state control over marriage, morality, and poor relief increased.
