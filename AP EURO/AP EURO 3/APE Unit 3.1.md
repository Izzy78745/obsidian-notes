## **I. The Aftermath of the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648)**

- **Peace of Westphalia (1648):**
    
    - Ended large-scale religious wars in Europe.
        
    - Weakened the Holy Roman Empire → local rulers gained sovereignty.
        
    - Papacy lost political influence → states now acted independently of the Church.
        
- **Result:** States were free to pursue **politics, economics, and military power** without religious constraints.

## **II. Economic Shifts**

- **Mercantilism:**
    
    - Dominant economic theory: wealth measured by gold/silver.
    - Export > import; colonies serve the mother country.
    - Close link between **state and economy** (e.g., Colbert in France).
- **Commercial Revolution:**
    
    - Trade networks expanded (Atlantic economy, colonial empires).
    - Rise of banking and finance (Bank of Amsterdam, stock exchanges).
    - Power shifted from Mediterranean states (Spain, Italy) to **Atlantic states** (France, England, Dutch Republic).

## **III. Political Thought**

- **Absolutism Justified:**
    
    - **Jean Bodin** (1530–1596): first theorist of absolutism → sovereignty must be undivided.
    - **Thomas Hobbes** (_Leviathan_, 1651): humans are selfish → need absolute ruler to maintain order and prevent anarchy.
- **Constitutionalism Justified:**
    
    - **John Locke** (_Two Treatises of Government_, 1690): natural rights (life, liberty, property); government is a contract with the people.
    - If rulers violate rights, subjects can rebel.

## I**V. Absolutism vs. Constitutionalism (Two Models of Government)**

- **Absolutism:**
    
    - Monarchs claimed **divine right** (power comes from God, accountable only to Him).
    - Examples: Louis XIV (France), Peter the Great (Russia), Frederick William I (Prussia).
    - Nobility weakened, bureaucracy strengthened, state centralized.
- **Constitutionalism:**
    
    - Power shared between monarch and representative institutions.
    - Example: England (Parliamentary monarchy), Dutch Republic (merchant oligarchy).
    - Nobles, merchants, and towns retained political influence.

## **VI. Religion’s Changing Role**

- After 1648, religion stopped being the _primary_ driver of politics:
    
    - Wars were now more about **dynastic and territorial rivalry** (France vs Habsburgs, England vs France, etc.).
    - **State interests > religious unity** → raison d’état (“reason of state”), especially under Cardinal Richelieu in France.
---

## **VII. Broader Context**

- **Social Hierarchies:**
    
    - Nobles resisted centralization but were often co-opted into service of monarchs.
        
    - Peasants bore heavy tax burdens → frequent revolts (Russia, France, Spain).
        
- **Cultural Developments:**
    
    - Absolutism glorified through art/architecture (Versailles, Baroque palaces).
        
    - Constitutionalism fostered civic values and commercial culture (Dutch Golden Age).
