#            Economic Development and Mercantilism
## **I. Background: Commercial Revolution Continues**

- Since 1450–1648, Europe saw:
    
    - Growth of **Atlantic trade** (sugar, tobacco, coffee, slaves).
    - Expansion of banking and finance (Bank of Amsterdam, stock exchanges).
- After 1648, **economic competition** became tied directly to **state power**: stronger economies = stronger armies/navies.
- Result: rise of **mercantilism** as the dominant economic policy.

## **II. Mercantilism Defined**

- **Mercantilism = wealth = power.**
    
    - Wealth measured by gold and silver (bullionism).
        
    - Colonies exist to enrich the mother country.
        
    - Government regulates trade and production heavily.
        
    - Goal: maximize exports, minimize imports.
        
- State-controlled system → very different from modern capitalism (which emphasizes free trade).

## **III. Mercantilism in France (Jean-Baptiste Colbert)**

- **Colbert (finance minister for Louis XIV):**
    
    - Expanded **state-controlled industries**: textiles, mining, shipbuilding.
        
    - Built infrastructure (roads, canals) to improve internal trade.
        
    - High tariffs on foreign goods → protect French industries.
        
    - Encouraged overseas colonies (Caribbean sugar islands, fur trade in Canada).
        
- **Impact:** boosted short-term wealth, but rigid regulations stifled innovation and peasant burden grew under taxation.

## **IV. Mercantilism in England and the Dutch Republic**

- **England:**
    
    - **Navigation Acts (1651, 1660, 1663):**
        
        - Only English ships could carry English goods.
            
        - Goal: weaken Dutch trade dominance.
            
    - Growth of colonies (North America, Caribbean, India).
        
    - Financial innovations: **Bank of England (1694)**, insurance markets, stock exchanges.
        
    - Joint-stock companies (e.g., **British East India Company**).
        
- **Dutch Republic:**
    
    - Earlier leader in global commerce.
        
    - **Dutch East India Company (VOC)** dominated Asian spice trade.
        
    - **Bank of Amsterdam (1609):** stable currency, trusted internationally.
        
    - Dutch declined after late 17th c. due to wars with England/France.

## **V. Spain and Portugal**

- **Spain:**
    
    - Relied heavily on bullion from Americas.
        
    - Poor internal economy → inflation, decline of manufacturing.
        
    - Colonies tightly controlled but inefficient.
        
- **Portugal:**
    
    - Profited from Brazil (sugar, gold) and colonies in Africa/Asia.
        
    - Eventually overshadowed by England and Netherlands.

## **VI. The Atlantic Economy**

- **Triangular Trade:**
    
    - Europe → manufactured goods → Africa.
        
    - Africa → slaves (Middle Passage) → Americas.
        
    - Americas → raw goods (sugar, cotton, tobacco, coffee) → Europe.
        
- Fueled growth of **port cities** (London, Bristol, Liverpool, Amsterdam).
    
- Enslaved labor = foundation of profits → links to rise of capitalism and global inequality.

## **VII. Criticisms and Alternatives**

- **Physiocrats (early 18th century France):**
    
    - Criticized mercantilism, argued agriculture was real source of wealth.
        
- **Adam Smith (later in 1776, _Wealth of Nations_):**
    
    - Criticized mercantilism as zero-sum.
        
    - Advocated **free trade**, limited government interference (laissez-faire).
        
- Although Smith is later (Unit 5 Enlightenment), his critique shows the decline of mercantilism.
