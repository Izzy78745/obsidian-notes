#                     The Dutch Golden Age
## **I. Political Structure — Oligarchy of Urban Gentry**

- After winning independence from Spain in the **Dutch Revolt (1568–1648)**, the **United Provinces of the Netherlands** became a **republic** (confirmed by the Peace of Westphalia, 1648).
    
- Instead of a king:
    
    - Power rested in the **Estates General** (a federal assembly).
    - Each province had its own **provincial estates** dominated by wealthy merchants and landowners.
    - Local government = **oligarchy of urban gentry** → wealthy urban elites, merchants, and bankers controlled politics.
- Nobility was weak compared to France or Spain → merchants ruled.
    
- This oligarchic system gave more autonomy to cities and provinces → decentralized, but stable enough because of shared commercial interests.

## **II. William of Orange (a central figure)**

- **William the Silent (1533–1584):** founder of Dutch independence against Spain.
- Later, the **House of Orange** provided the office of **stadtholder** (military leader of a province).
- The **Orangists** favored stronger central leadership, especially during wartime.
- **William III of Orange (r. 1672–1702):**
    
    - Became stadtholder during crisis with France (Louis XIV invaded in 1672).
    - Married Mary Stuart of England.
    - In 1689, after the **Glorious Revolution**, he and Mary became co-monarchs of England → linking Dutch and English politics.
    - As king of England, William brought Dutch financial institutions (e.g., Bank of Amsterdam model → Bank of England).

## **III. Economy — Commercial and Financial Powerhouse**

- Amsterdam = **financial center of Europe**.
    
- **Bank of Amsterdam (1609):** early modern central bank, stabilized currency, boosted confidence in Dutch trade.
    
- **Dutch East India Company (VOC, 1602):** joint-stock company; controlled Asian trade, dominated spices, set up colonies.
    
- **Dutch West India Company:** active in the Americas and West Africa (slavery, sugar trade).
    
- Shipbuilding industry was world-leading (fluyts = cheap, efficient cargo ships).
    
- Controlled carrying trade (transporting goods for other nations).
    
- Wealth flowed into urban centers → fueled art, culture, and science.

## **IV. Art and Culture**

- The Dutch Golden Age saw **Baroque art with a middle-class twist**:
    
    - Artists like **Rembrandt**, **Vermeer**, **Frans Hals** painted portraits, landscapes, and domestic scenes rather than just religious or royal themes.
        
    - Reflected wealth of merchants and civic pride.
        
- Culture was civic, practical, and tied to commerce — unlike Versailles, which glorified monarchy.

## **VI. Decline**

- Late 17th–early 18th century:
    
    - Wars with France and England drained resources.
        
    - England and France surpassed the Dutch in trade and colonies.
        
    - Power shifted from Amsterdam → London (Bank of England, British navy).
