#         Absolutism in Eastern and Western Europe
## **I. Western Europe — France as the Model of Absolutism**

- **Cardinal Richelieu (1624–1642):**
    
    - Chief minister to Louis XIII.
    - Weakened nobles by destroying their fortified castles.
    - Reduced power of Huguenots (though he did not fully revoke Nantes).
    - Strengthened intendants (royal officials who enforced law/taxes).
    - Practiced _raison d’état_ (reason of state) — put state interests above religion (a Catholic supporting Protestants in Thirty Years’ War).
- **Louis XIV (1643–1715), “Sun King”:**
    
    - Claimed **divine right monarchy** (“L’état, c’est moi” — “I am the state”).
    - Built **Versailles** to control nobles — kept them busy with rituals instead of politics.
    - **Revoked Edict of Nantes (1685):** forced religious uniformity, persecuted Huguenots (many fled → economic loss).
    - **Military:** massive standing army, fought wars of expansion (vs Habsburgs, Dutch, English).
    - **Economy:** Colbert’s mercantilism (export > import, tariffs, colonies for raw materials).
- **Impact:** France became the **model absolutist state**, admired and copied across Europe.

## **II. Spain — Decline of Absolutism**

- 16th-century strength under Charles V and Philip II declined by 17th century.
- Causes: costly wars (Dutch Revolt, Spanish Armada failure, Thirty Years’ War), economic stagnation (inflation from silver, decline of manufacturing).
- Nobles retained power → monarchy remained less centralized.
- By 1700, Spain was a weakened absolutist state.

## **III. Central Europe — Austrian Habsburgs**

- **Background:** Habsburgs lost dominance in Holy Roman Empire after 1648 → turned focus to consolidating Austria.
- **Strategy:**
    
    - Recovered Hungary from Ottomans (Battle of Vienna, 1683).
    - Controlled diverse groups: Germans, Magyars, Czechs, Italians.
    - Centralized authority through Catholicism and military power.
- **Limits:** Could not fully centralize because of ethnic diversity and noble privileges (especially Hungarian nobility).

## **IV. Prussia — The “Military State”**

- **Frederick William, the Great Elector (1640–1688):**
    
    - Built a strong army after devastation of Thirty Years’ War.
    - Made deal with nobles (**Junkers**): nobles kept serfs → in exchange, they supported taxation for military.
- **Frederick William I (1713–1740):**
    
    - Known as the “Soldier King.”
    - Militarized society — army became core of state identity.
    - Centralized bureaucracy to support army (General Directory).
- **Impact:** Prussia became a **rising power in Europe**, defined by military discipline.

## **V. Russia — The Rise of the Tsars**

- **Peter the Great (1682–1725):**
    
    - Determined to “Westernize” Russia after visiting Europe.
    - Built new capital → **St. Petersburg** (“window to the West”).
    - Imposed Western clothing, shaved beards, modernized army/navy.
    - Controlled nobility through **Table of Ranks** (noble status tied to state service).
    - Expanded territory: defeated Sweden in Great Northern War (1700–1721).
        
- **Absolutist Nature:**
    
    - Tsar = autocrat, head of both church (abolished Patriarch, created Holy Synod) and state.
        
    - Serfdom deepened to keep nobility loyal.
        
- **Impact:** Russia emerged as a **major European power**, but at high social cost for peasants.
