# Protestantism in France

###### Like half of Frances nobility were now Huguenots, which are just Calvinists. Then Charles IX came into power but only at 9 years old Catherine De 'Medici basically became regent and ruled the country and killed a lot of them.

##### Then the Bartholomew Day Massacre happened where Henry of Navarre was going to get married in Paris and a lot of Huguenots came and Charles IX under Catherine's influence killed them all

# War of three Henry's
###### Henry III was on the throne already, But wasn't catholic enough for Henry of Guise who led the Catholic League, and so with the Spanish, Guise Henry took the throne. Henry III later assassinated him and joined Henry of Navarre to get rid of the Holy League. Then Henry III was assasinated leaving Henry of Navarre to the throne. And when Henry IV came around he basically said "aight France is Catholic but Huguenots can exist."
