# THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION.  


- ## **Alright so now we start with the ==Avignon Papacy==**
	- ##### So basically in the middle ages the Roman Catholic Popes and European kings (especially the king of France) had disputes. In 1309 the King of France pressured the new Pope to make the new Papacy in Avignon. All of the popes in Avignon were bad and only cared about themselves.
	
	- ##### And then in 1377 the Papacy went back to Rome under the leadership of a good Pope who didn't want any of that to happen again. But that led to a shit ton of disputes and then the Avignon Papacy just said "HEY FUCK YOU" and elected their own pope because they're just that guy fr. So now we got ==two different Popes who say they're the pope== and the average persons like "dude wtf" and thinks that the papacy massively flawed, thinking that the papacy cared more about themselves then guiding the faith.

- ## **Now onto the bad things they did**
	- ##### One bad thing they did was called ==Simony==. Simony was the selling of church positions to basically people who could afford it. This was mostly done because people with these positions would usually not be taxed (always bout them damn taxes smh).
	- ##### In the 12th century the church decided that Purgatory existed because they felt that if you didn't confess all your sins to the cardinals (or whoever the fuck else does it) you should go there to cleanse of your sins, and that will take some time to happen. And then in the 16th cent==Pope Leo X decided to monetize that shit to fund the construction of St. Peter's Basilica, basically selling get out of Purgatory free cards==.


- ## THE GOAT MARTIN LUTHER
	- ##### Martin Luther was a monk and honestly had anxiety of confessing his sins (me to bro) but then he made a discovery. He was studying Romans chapter 1 in the new testament. He figured out that it was not paying to get rid of your sins but instead god forgave based off the finished work of Christ (Heimler said that idk what that means). The more he read into it he saw how the Papacy was very diverged from the bible actually.
	- ##### Then he made up Sola Scriptura meaning scripture alone and that the final authority was the bible and not the papacy. Then he made the 95 thesis and then nailed it on the door. Then the printing press actually spread it across the HRE and a lot of people agreed with him. Then the Church officals denounced him as a heritic and brought him before "The Diet of Worms" saying to denounce his claims and basically just said no.

- ## John Calvin
	- ##### One of the things this guy did was systematize the Protestant doctrine, in which he named The Institutes of the Christian Religion. 
		- His first doctrine was Predestination- It stated that God had decided from before the world was even created, who would be saved or go to hell. And therefore Salvation and Damnation was not of human choice but of God's choice
