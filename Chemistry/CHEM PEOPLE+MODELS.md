	- Atoms are small and indivisible; enter into compounds in regular ratios
	- All atoms of the same element are identical
	- No concept of subatomic particles

- ## Rutherford’s Model
	- ##### Early 1900s
	- ##### Gold foil experiment discovered the nucleus
	- ##### Alpha particles (positively charged) were fired at gold foil; some deflected or bounced back
	- ##### Disproved the plum pudding model and established that the nucleus is dense and contains most of the atom’s mass
	- ##### Omitted existence of neutrons

- ## ### Bohr’s Planetary Model
	- ##### One of the things this guy did was systematize the Protestant doctrine, in which he named The Institutes of the Christian Religion. 

-----

- ## Anabaptists
	- ##### They basically believed in the same principles as Luther and Calvin but separated from them on the terms of baptism. They basically believed that only adults should be baptized, as only they can confess their belief in christ while an infant.. well they can't (duh).
