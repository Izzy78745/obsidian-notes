- ## **Dalton’s Atomic Model**
	-  Early 1800s
	- Atoms are small and indivisible; enter into compounds in regular ratios
	- All atoms of the same element are identical
	- No concept of subatomic particles

- ## **### Thomson’s Plum Pudding**
	- ##### 1890s
	- ##### Cathode Ray Tube
	- #####  Confirmed the existence of the electron
	- ##### Throught electrons embedded in a positively charged sphere (wrong)

- ## Rutherford’s Model
	- ##### Early 1900s
	- ##### Gold foil experiment discovered the nucleus
	- ##### Alpha particles (positively charged) were fired at gold foil; some deflected or bounced back
	- ##### Disproved the plum pudding model and established that the nucleus is dense and contains most of the atom’s mass
	- ##### Omitted existence of neutrons

- ## Bohr’s Planetary Model
	- ##### 1922: Nobel Prize awarded for the model
	- ##### Electrons orbiting the nucleus already understood at his time
	- ##### First to get credit for proposing that the energy levels are quantized
	- ##### Model fails to explain accurately for elements larger than Helium

-----

- ## Isotopes
	- ##### Isotopes are two atoms of the same element with different masses
	- ##### They have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons
	- ##### Chemical behavior is the same because the number of protons (and thus the element) is the same

- ## Ions
	- An ion is an atom that has a non-zero charge
