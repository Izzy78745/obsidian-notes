- ## **Dalton’s Atomic Model!**
	- #####  Early 1800s
	- ##### Atoms are small and indivisible; enter into compounds in regular ratios
	- ##### All atoms of the same element are identical
	- ##### No concept of subatomic particles

----
- ## **JJ Thomson’s Plum Pudding**
	- #####  1890s
	- ##### Cathode Ray Tube
	- ##### Confirmed the existence of the electron
	- ##### Thought electrons were embedded in a positively-charged sphere (WRONG)

- ## **Rutherford’s Model**
	- #####  Early 1900s
	- ##### Discovered the nucleus with the gold foil experiment
	- ##### Alpha particles (positive charge) and gold foil; noticed that they sometimes bounced back
	- ##### Disproved plum pudding and realized nucleus existed/is dense
	- ##### Omitted existence of neutrons

- ## **Bohr’s Planetary Model**
	- #####  1922 Nobel Prize
	- ##### Electrons orbiting the nucleus already understood at his time
	- ##### First to get credit for proposing that the energy levels are quantized
	- ##### Model fails to explain accurately for elements larger than Helium
----
- ## **Isotopes**
	- ##### Isotopes are two atoms of the same element that have different masses

- ## **Ions**
	- ##### An ion is an atom that has a non-zero charge (positive or negative)
