- ## THE GOAT MARTIN LUTHER
	- ##### Martin Luther was a monk and honestly had anxiety of confessing his sins (me to bro) but then he made a discovery. He was studying Romans chapter 1 in the new testament. He figured out that it was not paying to get rid of your sins but instead god forgave based off the finished work of Christ (Heimler said that idk what that means). The more he read into it he saw how the Papacy was very diverged from the bible actually.
	- ##### Then he made up Sola Scriptura meaning scripture alone and that the final authority was the bible and not the papacy. Then he made the 95 thesis and then nailed it on the door. Then the printing press actually spread it across the HRE and a lot of people agreed with him. Then the Church officials denounced him as a heretic and brought him before "The Diet of Worms" saying to denounce his claims and basically just said no.

- ## John Calvin
	- ##### One of the things this guy did was systematize the Protestant doctrine, in which he named The Institutes of the Christian Religion. 
		- - His first doctrine was Predestination- It stated that God had decided from before the world was even created, who would be saved or go to hell. And therefore Salvation and Damnation was not of human choice but of God's choice
		- The second was called Elect- The elect were those who God chose to save and had no choice in the matter, and could never lose their salvation.
	- ## He basically ran a Theology in his town also
		- He made it so that the bible was basically law and that financial wealth was the proper reward for hard work and as well as they didn't allow money to become their got, then their wealth would be a sign of God's favor. And if you don't agree with him you get burnt at the stake like he did with Michael Servetus who disagreed with baptism

- ## Anabaptists
	- ##### They basically believed in the same principles as Luther and Calvin but separated from them on the terms of baptism. They basically believed that only adults should be baptized, as only they can confess their belief in christ while an infant.. well they can't (duh).
