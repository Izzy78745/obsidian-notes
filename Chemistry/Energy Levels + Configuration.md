- ## **Energy Levels**
	- ##### Each energy level has a number called the PRINCIPAL QUANTUM NUMBER, n
	- ##### Currently n can be 1 thru 7, because there are 7 periods on the periodic table, n is literally the period number

- ## **Principle Quantum Number: n**
	- ##### Always a positive integer (1,2, 3â€¦7)
	- ##### Indicates size of orbital, or how far electron is from nucleus
	- ##### Larger n value = larger orbital or distance from nucleus

- ## **Types of Sublevels, aka Orbitals**
	- ##### The most probable area to find these electrons, in each level, takes on a specific shape
	- ##### - So far, we are aware of 4 shapes named s, p, d, and f

	###### s < p < d < f
