- ## **Valence Electrons!**
	- #####  These are the electrons existing in the outermost s and p orbitals only (more on this later)
	- ##### Octet Rule: atoms are most stable when their valence shell is either completely full or completely empty
	- ##### Atoms with 1, 2 or 3 valence electrons will want to lose them
	- ##### Atoms with 5, 6, or 7 valence electrons will want to gain more to have 8

- ## **TRENDS!**
	- ###  Ionization energy
		- ##### The amount of energy needed to remove an electron from an atom
			![[Ionization_energy_periodic_table.svg]]
	- ### **Electronegativity and electron affinity**
		- ##### Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons in a chemical bond
			Electronegativity generally increases as you move up groups
			Electronegativity increases as you move across a period

	- ### **Atomic radius**
		- c'mon man u know this, its literally the radius
