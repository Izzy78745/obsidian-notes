#                    THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION.  


- ## **Valence Electrons!**
	- #####  These are the electrons existing in the outermost s and p orbitals only (more on this later)
	- ##### Octet Rule: atoms are most stable when their valence shell is either completely full or completely empty
	- ##### Atoms with 1, 2 or 3 valence electrons will want to lose them
	- ##### Atoms with 5, 6, or 7 valence electrons will want to gain more to have 8
